abstract: Two characteristics of location-based services are mobile trajectories and the ability to facilitate social networking. The recording of trajectory data contributes valuable resources towards understanding users’ geographical movement behaviors. Social networking is possible when users are able to quickly connect to anyone nearby. A social network with location based services is known as location-based social network (LBSN). As shown in Cho et al. [2013], locations that are frequently visited by socially related persons tend to be correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. To better analyze and mine LBSN data, we need to have a comprehensive view of each of these two aspects, i.e., the mobile trajectory data and the social network.Specifically, we present a novel neural network model that can jointly model both social networks and …
