abstract: Attributed graph embedding, which learns vector representations from graph topology and node features, is a challenging task for graph analysis. Recently, methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have made great progress on this task. However,existing GCN-based methods have three major drawbacks. Firstly,our experiments indicate that the entanglement of graph convolutional filters and weight matrices will harm both the performance and robustness. Secondly, we show that graph convolutional filters in these methods reveal to be special cases of generalized Laplacian smoothing filters, but they do not preserve optimal low-pass characteristics. Finally, the training objectives of existing algorithms are usually recovering the adjacency matrix or feature matrix, which are not always consistent with real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Graph Encoder (AGE), a …
